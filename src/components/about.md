I've had this horrible habit for years of picking up and putting down hobbies.
For a few weeks or months at a time, all I want to do is `X`
Then all of a sudden, I won't want to do `X` anymore, so I move onto `Y`.
And then I don't do `X` again for months, sometimes years.
Of course, the same fate awaits `Y`.
On and on it goes, like clockwork.

This habit has made me a bit of a jack of all trades and master of none.
This can be good, but the downside is I haven't felt I've made meaningful progress in any given hobby for a while.
For example, I'm at a plateau with playing the guitar and digital art, but I haven't been able to break through since neither holds my interest long-term anymore.
Meanwhile, I develop new skills and explore new hobbies at a snail's pace since I don't ever invest enough time to go beyond novice phase.

This blog, then, is my attempt at addressing all that.
I think documenting my learning journeys and seeing that progress over time will help.
I also enjoy sharing knowledge and teaching.
So if this blog can be as much help to you, random internet stranger, as it is to me, then that would make me happy.
